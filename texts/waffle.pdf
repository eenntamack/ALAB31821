Eggs:This waffle recipe starts with two whole eggs, whisked until light and fluffy.
Flour: All-purpose flour adds gluten, which gives the waffles structure. You can also use whole wheat flour.
Milk: Whole milk lends richness and moisture. Plus, it helps create the ideal batter consistency.
Oil: A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, ensures the waffles are nice and moist.
Sugar: A tablespoon of white sugar adds the perfect amount of sweetness.
Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it contributes to the waffles' light and fluffy texture.
Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the other flavors. Don't skip this step!
Vanilla: A dash of vanilla adds complexity and enhances the overall flavor.
Cooking spray: You'll need to spray the iron with nonstick cooking spray before you start making the waffles.
